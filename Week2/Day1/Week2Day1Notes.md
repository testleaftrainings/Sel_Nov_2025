### Methods:
1. **Definition:**
    A method in Java is a set of instructions or a block of code encapsulated within a named unit. It is designed to perform a specific task and can be invoked (called) from other parts of the program. Methods promote code reusability, modularization, and a more organized code structure. They are defined by the method's signature, which includes its name, parameters, and return type.
2. **Explanation:**
     *Declaration:* Methods are declared with a return type, a name, and parameters (if any).
     *Return Type:* Specifies the type of data the method will return, or "void" if it doesn't return anything.
     *Parameters:* Input values passed to the method for processing.    

### Objects:
1. **Definition:**
   In Java, an object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity or concept. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to the entity they represent. They are created from class blueprints and follow the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Objects interact with each other through method calls and can store and manipulate data.
2. **Explanation**   
    Instantiation: Objects are created from classes using the new keyword.
    Attributes (Fields): Define the properties of an object.
    Behaviors (Methods): Define the actions an object can perform.
